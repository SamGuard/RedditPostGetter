# RedditPostGetter-git
This is a web app made in node js using express that gets reddit posts from a subreddit

To run this use node js and type the command: "npm start" in the directory.

You will need node.js installed on your machine to run this

How it works:
This works using the request module that comes with node, this retrieves the information from the specified subreddit and returns the filtered JSON which is then displayed in a table on the page. This uses the http module to host the server and Express web framework to handle incoming http requests.
